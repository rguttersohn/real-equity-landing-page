    <h2>Join us in October for R.E.A.L. Talk</h2>
<p>
	If ever there was a moment to dig in and fight for true and lasting equity for all New Yorkers, the time is now. 
</p>
<p>
  We invite you to participate in Racial Equity Advancement Labs (R.E.A.L.), a series of convenings that will unpack the structural and institutional barriers that disproportionately keep people of color living in or near poverty, and advance race-conscious policies and programs to establish economic security and well-being for all.
</p>

<p>
  R.E.A.L. is a collaboration of three New York City-based nonprofits - Citizen’s Committee for Children, FPWA and United Neighborhood Houses – that are committed to building just and equitable communities as our city recovers and rebuilds from Covid-19 and its fallout. 
</p>
<p>
  We hope you’ll join us on Thursdays in October for R.E.A.L. Talks, a series of virtual conversations every week. Each of the five Thursday morning conversations will be centered on one of the core pillars of true equality.
</p>
    <h2 class="event-emphasis">Registration is now open for all webinars</h2>
    <p>
      Join us for a series of virtual conversations each Thursday in October. The conversations will focus on five key pillars of equity:

    </ul>
