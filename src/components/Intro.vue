    <p>We invite you to participate in <strong>Racial Equity Advancement Labs (R.E.A.L.)</strong>, a series of convenings that will unpack the structural and institutional barriers that disproportionately keep people of color living in or near poverty, and will advance race-conscious policies and programs to establish economic security and well-being for all.</p>

    <p><strong>R.E.A.L.</strong> is a collaboration of three New York City-based nonprofits – Citizens' Committee for Children, FPWA and United Neighborhood Houses – that are committed to building just and equitable communities as our city recovers and rebuilds from Covid-19 and its fallout.</p>

    <p>We hope you’ll join us on Thursdays in October for <strong>R.E.A.L. Talks</strong>, a series of virtual conversations every week. Each of the five Thursday morning conversations will be centered on one of the core pillars of true equality.</p>

    <h2>Be a Part of the Conversation</h2>
