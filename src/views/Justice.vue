              As our city begins to focus on recovery and rebuilding, Citizenâ€™s Committee for Children, FPWA, United Neighborhood Houses, and UJA Federation of New York have joined together to host the Racial Equity Advancement Lab (R.E.A.L.), a collaborative effort to convene and mobilize New Yorkers committed to advancing racial justice.
            </p> 
            <p>
              Through a series of virtual conversations each Thursday in October, we will focus on five key pillars of equity- economic equity, education equity, housing equity, health equity, and justice equity- that will need to be addressed in order for our city to truly address fairness and equity for all.
