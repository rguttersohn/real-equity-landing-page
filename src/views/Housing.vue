              More than 90,000 New Yorkers are currently experiencing homelessness.  In NYC, families with children comprise 70% of the cityâ€™s shelter system. Each year, the number of students in temporary housing continues to trend upward.</p><p>To ensure all New Yorkers--individuals, families, and older adults-- have stable housing, we must address inequities experienced by the severely rent burdened, those living in overcrowded housing and those with a lack of access to housing supports.
