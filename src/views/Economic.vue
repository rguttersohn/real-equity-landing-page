            <p>
              Nearly one in five New Yorkers, a majority of whom are from communities of color or immigrant backgrounds, are living in poverty. Nearly 40% are unable to afford basic household needs for themselves or their family.
            </p>

               These disparities are not new, but rather the result of purposeful and systemic economic exclusion for generations of Black and brown communities. How did we get here and how do we begin to address these deep, historic economic disparities across our city?
